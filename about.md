Welcome!

My name is Ayal Nogovitsyn, I am an junior data scientist who's interested in machine learning,
explorational analytics and data visualisation. I have finished a data science course in Computer Training Centre “Specialist” at the Bauman Moscow State Technical University, Bauman MSTU (Sep - Dec 2019). This course had a good grasp on the basics on working with data, such a as data scanning, cleaning data and data analytics. Further dive into machine learning and algorithms.

I mainly use Python with Jupyter Notebooks, however I also tried working in R and SQL.
